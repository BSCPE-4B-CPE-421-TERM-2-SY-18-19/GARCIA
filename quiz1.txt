I observe during the troubleshooting, We don't have the right tools 
but we use  an alternative tools so we can troubleshoot the system 
unit.First the CPU power is turn on but the CPU does not. We found
out that the power supply fuse is fried.

Replace the fuse from the power supply then turn on the CPU then 
troubleshoot if any problem were found then troubleshoot further
